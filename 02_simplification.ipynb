In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats.

Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.\n",

METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively. Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.\n",

METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs.

            "Original sentence: Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.\n",

However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs. METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs.

            "Original sentence: PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. RESULTS: Testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng./ml.). Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years.

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds. We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC 123) and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124). All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane. We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease. METHODS: For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done. The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-P450 2E1 (P450 2E1) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (P58). FINDINGS: The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging necrosis). Trifluoroacetyl-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with halothane hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population. Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known, the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl-altered liver proteins are involved. In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives.\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1).

Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group. However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.\n",

When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose.

Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance.

In the present study, cis-platin (80-120 mg/m2BSA) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery. The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment. Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed. In the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients (43%). During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%). The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years. The incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation. The most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain, ST-T wave changes and atrial fibrillation. This was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in another. It is concluded that patients on 5-FU treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachyarrhythmia is observed.\n",

            "Original sentence: To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen-induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine (3 mg/kg of body weight). One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly. Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells. Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased. These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules. At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls. The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae. Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells. However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells. An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis, suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion.\n",

Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia.

The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits.

The ventricular fibrillation threshold be measure by pass a gated train of 12 changeless current pulsation through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable time_period of the cardiac cycle . During the infusion of aminophylline , the ventricular fibrillation threshold be reduce by 30 to 40 percentage of the control when pH and partial pressure of oxygen ( PO2 ) and carbon dioxide ( carbon_dioxide ) be keep within normal limit . When respiratory failure be produce by hypoventilation ( pH 7.05 to 7.25 ; PC02 70 to 100 millimeter mercury : P02 20 to 40 millimeter mercury ) , infusion of aminophylline result in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percentage of the control degree . These experiment propose that although many factor may lend to the increase incidence of ventricular cardiac_arrhythmia in respiratory failure , pharmacological agent , particularly aminophylline , may play a significant function .\n",

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. The neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin. CONCLUSION: Activation of pallidal neurotensin receptors may be involved in neurotensin-induced antiparkinsonian effects.\n",

METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood.

Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex.

From January 1986 to January 2009, 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated: ATT alone was the cause in 70 (5.7%) patients. Another 15 (1.2%) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection. In 44 (62.8%) patients, ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis. ATT-ALF patients were younger (32.87 [+/-15.8] years), and 49 (70%) of them were women.

All of the rats in the saline-treated epileptic control group developed SRS, whereas none of the BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source. Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls. The donor-derived GFP(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats. In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI. The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily, 117) or placebo (twice daily, 117) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) (secondary outcome measures). Participants were followed biweekly during study period. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) scores for CGI-SF were significantly lower, i.e. better, in patients on bupropion SR, at 2.4 (1.2), than in the placebo group, at 3.9 (1.1) (P= 0.01). Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score (54.4% vs 1.2%; P= 0.003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF. Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i.e. better, among men who received bupropion than placebo, at 15.5 (4.3) vs 21.5 (4.7) (P= 0.002). The EDITS scores were 67.4 (10.2) for the bupropion and 36.3 (11.7) for the placebo group (P= 0.001). The ASEX score and CGI-SF score were correlated (P= 0.003). In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD, type of SSRI used and age.

In the following report, a 65-year-old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. The patient required massive transfusion support (55 units of red blood cells, 42 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 40 units of cryoprecipitate, 40 units of platelets, and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay. RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment]). CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient's extended coagulopathy.

We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD).

Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro. These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.\n",

The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model. Treatment with 150 mg/kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%.

            "Original sentence: Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)). Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice. In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity. However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.\n",

In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. Proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map. All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.

METHODS: The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto. RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia. Pretreatment with L-NOArg and L-NIL but not 7-NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140. It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine. Moreover, L-NOArg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des-Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy. In streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia, inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway. Therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain, even in hospital care.\n",

Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection.

Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and/or indirect drug-induced toxicity.

This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid.

Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events.

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Papaverine hydrochloride is a direct-acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations. Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine. This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm. Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients. The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations. FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss. The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min. In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II/III-V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine. Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min. One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss. The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre-papaverine baseline values was 39 min. CONCLUSIONS: Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway. The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve. Recommendations to avoid potential cranial nerve deficits from papaverine are provided.\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure. METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin-treated group. We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-K+ ATPase activity in vivo. We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model. RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles.

METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013).

Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.\n",

Because the central_nervous_system damage cause by methamphetamine and MPTP be highly selective for the district_attorney neural system in mouse model of neurotoxicity , we speculate that the CX3CR1 play a function in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation . mouse in which the CX3CR1 gene have be delete and replace with a complementary_DNA encode enhance green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) be treat with methamphetamine and analyze for striatal neurotoxicity . methamphetamine consume district_attorney , cause microglial activation , and increase body temperature in CX3CR1 smasher mouse to the same extent and over the same time course see in wild-type control . The effects of methamphetamine in CX3CR1 smasher mouse be not gender-dependent and make not widen beyond the corpus_striatum . Striatal microglia express eGFP constitutively show morphologic change after methamphetamine that be characteristic of activation . This response be restrict to the corpus_striatum and contrast aggressively with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surround brain area that be not damage by methamphetamine . We reason from these survey that CX3CR1 sign make not modulate methamphetamine neurotoxicity or microglial activation . furthermore , it look that striatal-resident microglia respond to methamphetamine with an activation cascade and then return to a survey state without undergo apoptosis or migration .\n",

Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages.

The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. Nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine.

            "Original sentence: Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido. Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen-induced LH surge. Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol. Sulpiride induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced. Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS. Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels independently. These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid-dependent manner. They also provide evidence for estradiol-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin.\n",

While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect.

METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses.

He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL). No toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of \"acute hepatitis of unknown origin,\" that occurred after telithromycin usage.

It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis.

            "Original sentence: Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.\n",

BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n",

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.\n",

            "Original sentence: PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.\n",

In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism. Terbutaline, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor, has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins. We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats. Newborn rats were given terbutaline (10 mg/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30. Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter. None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14. In behavioral tests, animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test. Our findings indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities, similar to those described in autism.

The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells.

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.\n",

Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies.

Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed.

Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis. Hormone therapy users were compared with never users. RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% (OR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index). The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol use. No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year.

The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities in mice. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg p.o.), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg i.c.v.) and thioperamide (THP) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se did not cause catalepsy. Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the catalepsy times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP (15 mg/kg i.p.). RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed but THP (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters.

METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure.

Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin, a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. The dose of gabapentin was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration. We found that (i) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) gabapentin suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation. The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal. These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.\n",

METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus calcium (500 mg/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) were given only calcium. Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits. Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon's test. Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated. RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change, P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33).

We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BE), to cause seizures.

Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures.

Whereas cocaine-induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death, those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death. Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression.

METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams.

In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.

In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control.

Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls.

This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain.

METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9).

This shunt of blood via a patent foramen ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose. This drug caused biventricular dysfunction, due to its negative inotropic effect, and hypotension, due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect.

Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli.

A selective antagonist of mGluR5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP; 5 mg/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above-mentioned methamphetamine effects.

OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects (VFD) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose GVG on cocaine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA). METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure (450 mg/kg) to an identical sub-chronic exposure (150 mg/kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1- or 3-day washout. Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg/kg (50 mg/kg per day) using a similar washout period. RESULTS: Sub-chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-chronic low dose GVG potentiates and extends the inhibition of cocaine-induced increases in dopamine, effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS.\n",

The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome. The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN-induced sodium retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.\n",

CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow-up period. T-cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients, but not in healthy controls. DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature. Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course, but complete remission was observed in all reported cases.

We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg DOX, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.\n",

Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks.

Given alone to any accumbal subregion, GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg/side) or CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg/side) did not change basal locomotor activity. Systemic cocaine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats.

Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity. METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol-na  ve Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. Animals were administered nicotine, carbachol, or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium-stimulated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions. RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice. However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal. Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.\n",

To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN, 20 mg/100g BW).

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.\n",

Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.\n",

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma. Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. WR-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received amifostine, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. Neither a tumor-protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial.\n",

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in the emergency department of a central-city teaching hospital. Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache, nausea, or vomiting were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2-minute push (bolus group) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15-minute period (infusion group). The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration. Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient-reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator-observed akathisia rating scale. The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled. One study participant was excluded after protocol violation. Seventy-three percent (73/99) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70% (70/99) for nausea. In the bolus group, 26.0% (13/50) had akathisia compared with 32.7% (16/49) in the infusion group (Delta=-6.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -24.6% to 11.2%).

            "Original sentence: Cocaine's ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects. Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: BD1018 (3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane), BD1063 (1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine), and LR132 (1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine). Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors. The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine, opioid, GABA(A) and NMDA receptors. In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with BD1018, BD1063, or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Moreover, post-treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals. In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 (3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine. At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, BD1018, BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Together, the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine-induced behaviors.\n",

Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it. METHODS: We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens (from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR. In addition to renal allografts with TG, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent glomerulonephritis, chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts (\"protocol biopsies\"). Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, malignant hypertension, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis. RESULTS: We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens. These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis, and cocaine-related acute renal failure. Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow-up periods of between 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well-developed PTCR and TG, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear. PTCR also occurs in certain native kidney diseases, though the association is not as strong as that for TG.

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar depression. METHOD: The response of 44 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale. Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV bipolar I vs. bipolar II), number of previous manic episodes, type of antidepressant therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and, more particularly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), use and type of mood stabilizers (lithium vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. RESULTS: Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced manic episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypomanic episodes. Sex, age, diagnosis (bipolar I vs. bipolar II), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching. The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer. In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium (15%, 4/26) than in patients not treated with lithium (44%, 8/18; p = .04). The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching (p = .008).

This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen (AAP)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (AMI)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg GSPE for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (AAP: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; DOX: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence. GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE. Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation.

We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048).

Age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage, size of the aneurysm, location of the aneurysm, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (P < 0.002). In patients in the study group, all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group (8 +/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +/- 5.4 mm; P = 0.05). The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant. Hunt and Hess grade (P < 0.005) and age (P < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use predisposed aneurysmal rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller aneurysms. Contrary to the published literature, this group did reasonably well with aggressive management.\n",

This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM-induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) and alpha-tocopherol acetate (alpha-TAc) (inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM-induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage. This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM-induced hemolysis. Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM-induced cell oxidative stress. Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane-cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. Either alpha-T or alpha-TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes. These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. Therefore, TAM-induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM, resulting in hemolytic anemia.

The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification. High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. These observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.\n",

Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can not be determine from the present survey , there be a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher degree of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum-fed rat compare with either of the group that be immune to Warfarin-induced artery calcification , Internet_Explorer , the 10-month-old rat and the restricted-diet , growth-inhibited young rat . This observation propose that increase susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be associate to higher serum phosphate degree . The second set of experiment analyze the possible synergy between vitamin vitamin_D and warfarin in artery calcification . high dose of vitamin vitamin_D be know to cause calcification of the artery medium in equally small as 3 to 4 days . high dose of the vitamin kelvin adversary warfarin be besides know to cause calcification of the artery medium , but at treatment times of 2 week or long yet not at 1 week . In the current survey , we investigate the synergy between these 2 treatment and establish that coincident warfarin administration dramatically increase the extent of calcification in the medium of vitamin D-treated rat at 3 and 4 days . There be a close analogue between the consequence of vitamin vitamin_D dose on artery calcification and the consequence of vitamin vitamin_D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which propose that vitamin vitamin_D may induce artery calcification through its consequence on serum calcium . Because warfarin treatment have no consequence on the elevation in serum calcium produce by vitamin vitamin_D , the synergy between warfarin and vitamin vitamin_D be probably best explain by the hypothesis that warfarin suppress the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor . high degree of matrix Gla protein be establish at site of artery calcification in rat treat with vitamin vitamin_D plus warfarin , and chemical analysis show that the protein that roll_up be indeed not gamma-carboxylated . These observation bespeak that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue of matrix Gla protein be apparently necessitate for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they be not necessitate for its accretion at calcification site .\n",

            "Original sentence: BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients. Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. Toxicity was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity. Three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.\n",
